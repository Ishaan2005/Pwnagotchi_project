# Pwnagotchi Packet Sniffer and Wireshark Analysis

A passive WPA handshaking sniffer and traffic analyzer built using a custom-configured **Pwnagotchi** running on a **Raspberry Pi Zero W** with a **Waveshare 2.13-inch e-Paper Display (Version 2)**. This project demonstrates automated packet capture, plugin extension, and offline analysis using Wireshark.

## üì¶ Project Overview

This project configures a custom Pwnagotchi instance to:

- Autonomously sniff WPA handshakes using bettercap.
- Extend functionality using custom `.toml` configuration.
- Use additional plugins like `age` and `exp` to simulate AI-like growth.
- Collect and store `.pcap` files for offline inspection.
- Perform traffic feature analysis in **Wireshark** to examine EAPOL handshakes and other characteristics.
